# What Is Smart Waste Management?
Smart waste management refers to any system that uses technology to make trash collection more efficient, cost-effective and environmentally friendly. Most of these systems are equipped with the Internet of Things (IoT), a monitoring technology that collects and tracks real-time data, to help optimize waste collection and spur future innovation.
